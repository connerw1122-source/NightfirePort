The user (2026-10-17): "09 level elevator buttons dont work. make sure we're prioritizing level work so we can actually complete each level completely and get all models and functions per level working" and "I want EVERYTHING covered. ALL ON FOOT LEVELS". Level work now runs ahead of everything else in the queue.

**Reproduce first, through the REAL path.** Load the level with `nf_view::load` (or `load_weapons` when a
level's own weapon is needed), move Bond with `Sim::step_bond` inputs (walking, turning, the use key, the
watch gadgets, the weapons), let the level's own scripts and triggers run, and observe. No teleporting past
a problem unless the task says so; a teleport to reach a spot is fine when the test then operates the
thing through the real input. Cite the decompile [M], the disc [D] or a fresh-boot PCSX2 value [L] for every
game claim; tests pin only proven behaviour.

## Your task: `level-0c-complete`, play 0700000c (the power station, part 1) from start to finish

1. A live walk test (extend `crates/nf-view/tests/walkreal_0700000c_live.rs`, un-ignore it) that plays the
   level from its start through the real input path and completes EVERY objective — the optional ones too —
   and exits the way the game does (the load into the next level, or the mission results). Every cut-scene
   on the route plays (skipped only with the game's own skip action), every scripted event fires.
2. Fix every blocker the walk hits: collision, doors, triggers, scripts, AI that stops progress, missing
   channel writers. Each fix gets its own focused test with a sister that fails on the old code.
3. In the report: the objective list with how each completes [M]/[D], the route, and anything the walk
   still cannot do with the exact reason.

Known open items on this level (start here): the yard ladder, the drawn gate, the latches; the sniper spots.

**No drawing**: the main agent draws every page (it compares each against PCSX2). You deliver the data, the state,
the flow and getters the draw code can call, in `crates/nf-view/src/menu.rs` (`FrontEnd`, `Page`, `action()`) or
`nf_game` as fits, with docs first (`docs/systems/<name>.md`, addresses + evidence tags) and tests (numbers/ids only,
ISO-gated where they read the disc, each with a sister assertion that can fail).

**Tests pin only proven behaviour.** Every assertion about what the game does cites its evidence: [M] a decompile
address that actually says it, [D] disc bytes, or [L] a live PCSX2 measurement from a FRESH boot (a save-state resume
skips the boot path). A guess, a port choice or an [S] item is never a hard assertion: mark it `// [S] unverified` and
keep it out of pass/fail. If an existing test contradicts the decompile, the TEST is wrong: fix it, with the address, and
say so in the report. Never weaken a decompile-backed test to make code pass.

**Run the crates your tests touch before pushing**, and report what you ran.

**Branch:** `s/level-0c-complete`.

- **Run the full suite with the fast runner, started in the background in your first minutes** (it fits the 2-hour window):
  `NF_ISO=<abs path> nohup python3 tools/test/suite.py > suite.out 2>&1 &` (docs/tools/test-suite.md; once `tools/test/suite.py`
  is on your branch: merge `origin/master` first). Read `tail -1 suite.out` and its FAILED/TIMEOUT lines before you push, and
  run it once more on your final tree (merged with `origin/master`). Report the total line.
