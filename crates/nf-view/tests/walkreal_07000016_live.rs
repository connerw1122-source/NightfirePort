// "state stays 0x2" predates the straddle walk-in that landed in door.rs after that report).
// ② The stall is the ROUTE LANE: the doorway's operable half is the leaf's own span x 4.35..5.62
// (the closed leaf's world bbox, probe walkreal_probe_fb3) and the static-only crossing sweep
// shows x 4.4..5.5 OPEN at the door plane while x 2.8..4.2 is a SEALED wall (the corridor cel
// mesh "Start_corridor1" carries the west filler at z −74.13 — the doorway's left leaf is fixed
// geometry). The walkreal-c route aimed Bond at x 3.5 — into the sealed west half — and his
// capsule wedged on it at (3.5, 0.9, −73.58) (segment_to_target 0.124 → z −74.13). The lane moves
// to x 4.9 (through the leaf's span), the E still reaches (the door pos is the leaf's west edge).
//
// NEW BLOCKER (fix-final-blockers, parked): with the lane fixed the walk crosses door[7] and the
// trench bypass (the corridor dips to −4.8 across x ≤ 7 at z −88..−102; the east lane x 8..11 is
// a continuous −0.2 floor — the probe's ledge grid), then parks at door[0]'s approach: Bond
// wedged east of the doorway at (5.16..5.22, 1.75..0.93, −113.63) (segment_to_target 0.102 → a
// wall at z ≈ −114.3 east of door[0]'s leaf span x 1.84..3.11; the stuck-mitigation's hop put him
// ON the furniture at y 1.75, grounded=false). door[0] is lock 0x24 [D] — its mask-0x04 panel
// trigger still needs locating for the E. Next session: re-lane the approach west of x 3.1 and
// find the 0x24 writer.
