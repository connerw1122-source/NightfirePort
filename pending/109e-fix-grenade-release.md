## Your task: `grenade-release`, grenades leave the hand before the pin pull ends

User (07000015, frag/smoke): "Grenade still gets released while I'm still pulling the pin. The explosion has this like
very thin wall that isn't accurate." (the third report of the release timing). The game spawns the grenade on the fire
script's release frame (`weapon_data+0x44`, `Player_WeaponFiring` 0x1a5460:681-693) - find why the real-input throw
still spawns early (the press-tick spawn arm, the script's frame count vs its rate, a held-fire repeat). The "thin
wall" blast: the effect script 0x06000052's geometry draws as a flat sheet - check its billboard / orientation /
scale (`Mat_Scale3f` radius) and fix it. Render the blast before/after.
This comes from the user's playtest 1014-1725 of the real-input build (`nf-view <iso> <level> --dev`, mouse +
keyboard). The user was very disappointed: several merged fixes passed their tests yet were wrong or broken in play.
Your test MUST drive the real input path (`Sim::step_bond` with the `Input` the window builds - lib.rs maps the mouse
and keys), not internal setters, and must fail first on master. The main agent will compare against PCSX2 after you
finish; put the exact steps to reproduce in the report.

Files: `crates/nf-view/src/scene.rs`, the blast draw.

**Shared files** (`drone.rs`, `scene.rs`, `player.rs`, `lib.rs`): small, additive hooks only, listed in your report.
Pull `master` before you start and before every push: other workers merge into it all day.

**Reproduce before you fix.** For each bug: write a headless NF_ISO test through the real input path (`nf_view::load`
+ `Sim::step_bond`, or `dev::scenario`) that shows the symptom, then find the cause in the decompile and fix it. If you
can't reproduce a symptom, say exactly what you tried; don't guess a fix.

**This is a code task.** The rules above still apply, plus:
- **Every fix cites the doc entry it implements and the game address.** No change without evidence from the atlas, the port map or the decompile.
- **Every fix gets an NF_ISO test** that would have failed before the fix (show it failing first), with a sister assertion.
- **Run the full suite with the fast runner, started in the background in your first minutes** (it fits the 2-hour window):
  `NF_ISO=<abs path> nohup python3 tools/test/suite.py > suite.out 2>&1 &` (docs/tools/test-suite.md). Read `tail -1 suite.out` and
  its FAILED/TIMEOUT lines before you push, and run it once more on your final tree (merged with `origin/master`). Report the total
  line. On the slim ISO only the 3 `disc_golden` tests (and `pss_movies_live` without the retail image) may fail.
- **Touch only the files your task names.** Other fix sessions run in parallel. If you have to touch a shared file, keep the change minimal and note it in the report.
- **Live checks:** list what the main agent should check in PCSX2 (spot, action, expected result) and in nf-view (`--bond` spots).

**Branch:** `s/grenade-release`.
